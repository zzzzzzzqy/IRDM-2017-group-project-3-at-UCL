In this project, features have been generated based on the datasets provided and several machine algorithms have been attempted. These includes the SVM, Random Forest, Extra Tree, Factorization Machine, Gradient Boosting, Adabosting Boosting, Xgboost and Deep Neural Network. It turns out the Xgboost generates a better a score which is 0.4388.
